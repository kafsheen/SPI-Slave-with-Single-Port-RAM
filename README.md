# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM
# SPI Slave with Single-Port RAM

This project implements an SPI Slave module interfaced with a Single-Port Synchronous RAM using Verilog.
It enables read and write operations via SPI communication, with the internal RAM serving as the storage for transferred data. The design ensures synchronous operation with the SPI clock while maintaining reliable data integrity between the communication and memory blocks.

## Features

- SPI Slave interface compliant with standard SPI modes.
- Full-duplex communication via MOSI and MISO.
- Single-Port Synchronous RAM for data storage.
- Supports both read and write operations.
- Synchronous operation with SCK from master.
- Parameterized memory depth and data width.
- Fully synthesizable Verilog code.
- Testbench for functional verification.
